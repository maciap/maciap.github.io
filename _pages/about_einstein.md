I am a postdoctoral researcher at Aalto University. 

I defended my [doctoral thesis](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/server/api/core/bitstreams/ac917662-a4bc-4659-98a1-b3388da81e31/content) in January 2024. 

My research interests include: 
   * Interpretable machine learning and trustworthy AI. 
   * Data mining, management and probabilistic methods.
   * Applications of linear algebra to machine learning and related areas.
